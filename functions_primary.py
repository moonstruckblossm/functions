# 1 | Exploring Built-in Functions
#
# Visit this documentation:
#   - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp
#   - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
#
# Using the documentation above of built in functions, complete the following operations:
#   1 - Print the absolute value of a negative number.
#   2 - Save the hexadecimal value of 21 to a variable. Print this variable while describing it.
#   3 - Print the id of the variable holding the hexadecimal value of 21.
#   4 - Print 2 ^ 5 using the function instead of **.
#   5 - Print the number 3.75123 after being rounded to the nearest integer.
#   6 - Get the length of your full name by adding the length of first and last name together. Print it.
#
# Hint: REMEMBER, functions are typically named after verbs or nouns. Notice that the main action for a lot of tasks is
# to print, a verb, that is also the name of the function print. Think about what is being asked of you and that should
# help you find the right function.
#
# 1 is done for you.

print('The absolute value of -15 is:', abs(-15))
